Correct Process to Add a New Physics Concept
To properly add a new physics concept to your application, follow these steps:

Add the definition to physicsDefinitions.ts:

'ConceptName': {
  title: 'ConceptName',
  category: 'CategoryName', // e.g., 'Mechanics', 'Magnetism', etc.
  definition: 'Brief definition of the concept',
  formula: 'Related formula if applicable',
  hasNotes: true
}

Add the concept to the hardcoded list in DefinitionsPage.tsx:

{
  term: 'ConceptName',
  definition: 'Brief definition of the concept',
  formula: 'Related formula if applicable',
  category: 'CategoryName'
}


Create detailed notes in an appropriate physicsNotes file:
Use physicsNotes.ts for basic concepts
Use physicsNotes2.ts or physicsNotes3.ts for more advanced concepts
Create a new file (e.g., physicsNotes4.ts) if needed
typescript
CopyInsert
'ConceptName': {
  title: 'ConceptName',
  description: 'Brief description of the concept',
  sections: [
    {
      title: 'Section Title',
      content: `Detailed content about the concept...`
    }
  ]
}
Import the notes file if it's new:
In PhysicsDefinitionList.tsx
In DefinitionsPage.tsx
Update the combinedNotes object in both files to include the new notes file.
Restart the application to see the changes.
This process ensures your concept appears in the definitions list and has detailed notes accessible when users click on it.
