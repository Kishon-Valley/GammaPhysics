## Key Applications of Newton's Laws

### 1. **Inclined Planes**
An inclined plane is a flat surface tilted at an angle to the horizontal. Objects on inclined planes experience forces due to gravity, normal force, and friction.

![Inclined Plane Forces](/images/physics/dynamics/inclined-plane.svg)
*Figure 2: Forces acting on an object on an inclined plane*

#### Key Equations:
- **Component of Weight Parallel to the Plane**:
  $$F_{\parallel} = m g \sin(\theta)$$
- **Component of Weight Perpendicular to the Plane**:
  $$F_{\perp} = m g \cos(\theta)$$
- **Normal Force**:
  $$F_N = m g \cos(\theta)$$
- **Frictional Force**:
  $$F_f = \mu F_N$$

#### Example:
A 10 kg block is placed on a 30° inclined plane with a coefficient of friction of 0.2. What is the acceleration of the block?

**Solution**:
1. Calculate the parallel and perpendicular components of the weight:
   $$F_{\parallel} = 10 \text{ kg} \times 9.81 \text{ m/s}^2 \times \sin(30^\circ) = 49.05 \text{ N}$$
   $$F_{\perp} = 10 \text{ kg} \times 9.81 \text{ m/s}^2 \times \cos(30^\circ) = 84.87 \text{ N}$$

2. Calculate the frictional force:
   $$F_f = \mu F_N = 0.2 \times 84.87 \text{ N} = 16.97 \text{ N}$$

3. Calculate the net force:
   $$F_{\text{net}} = F_{\parallel} - F_f = 49.05 \text{ N} - 16.97 \text{ N} = 32.08 \text{ N}$$

4. Calculate the acceleration:
   $$a = \frac{F_{\text{net}}}{m} = \frac{32.08 \text{ N}}{10 \text{ kg}} = 3.208 \text{ m/s}^2$$

### 2. **Pulleys**
Pulleys are used to change the direction of a force and to lift heavy objects. When analyzing pulley systems, we consider the tension in the rope and the forces acting on each object.

![Pulley System](/images/physics/dynamics/pulley-system.svg)
*Figure 3: A simple pulley system showing forces and tensions*

#### Key Equations:
- **Tension in the Rope**: The tension is the same throughout a massless, frictionless rope.
- **Newton's Second Law**: Apply \( F = m a \) to each object in the system.

#### Example:
Two masses, $m_1 = 5 \text{ kg}$ and $m_2 = 10 \text{ kg}$, are connected by a rope over a frictionless pulley. What is the acceleration of the system?

**Solution**:
1. Apply Newton's Second Law to each mass:
   - For $m_1$: $T - m_1 g = m_1 a$
   - For $m_2$: $m_2 g - T = m_2 a$

2. Solve the system of equations:
   $$T - 5 \text{ kg} \times 9.81 \text{ m/s}^2 = 5 \text{ kg} \times a$$
   $$10 \text{ kg} \times 9.81 \text{ m/s}^2 - T = 10 \text{ kg} \times a$$

3. Add the two equations to eliminate $T$:
   $$(10 \text{ kg} \times 9.81 \text{ m/s}^2) - (5 \text{ kg} \times 9.81 \text{ m/s}^2) = (5 \text{ kg} + 10 \text{ kg}) \times a$$
   $$49.05 \text{ N} = 15 \text{ kg} \times a$$

4. Solve for $a$:
   $$a = \frac{49.05 \text{ N}}{15 \text{ kg}} = 3.27 \text{ m/s}^2$$

---

### 3. **Connected Systems**
Connected systems involve multiple objects linked by ropes, springs, or other means. To analyze these systems, we apply Newton's Laws to each object and consider the forces acting on them.

![Connected Objects](/images/physics/dynamics/connected-objects.svg)
*Figure 4: Examples of connected object systems and their force analysis*

#### Example:
Two blocks, \( m_1 = 2 \text{ kg} \) and \( m_2 = 3 \text{ kg} \), are connected by a rope and pulled by a force of 20 N. What is the acceleration of the system?

**Solution**:
1. Apply Newton's Second Law to the entire system:
   $$F_{\text{net}} = (m_1 + m_2) a$$
   $$20 \text{ N} = (2 \text{ kg} + 3 \text{ kg}) \times a$$

2. Solve for \( a \):
   $$a = \frac{20 \text{ N}}{5 \text{ kg}} = 4 \text{ m/s}^2$$

---

### 4. **Circular Motion**
Circular motion involves objects moving along a circular path. The centripetal force required to keep the object moving in a circle is provided by tension, gravity, friction, or other forces.

![Circular Motion](/images/physics/dynamics/circular-motion.svg)
*Figure 5: Forces in circular motion - horizontal and vertical cases*

#### Key Equations:
- **Centripetal Force**:
  $$F_c = \frac{m v^2}{r}$$
- **Period of Motion**:
  $$T = \frac{2 \pi r}{v}$$

#### Example:
A 1 kg object is tied to a string and swung in a horizontal circle of radius 2 meters at a speed of 5 m/s. What is the tension in the string?

**Solution**:
1. Calculate the centripetal force:
   $$F_c = \frac{m v^2}{r} = \frac{1 \text{ kg} \times (5 \text{ m/s})^2}{2 \text{ m}} = 12.5 \text{ N}$$

2. The tension in the string provides the centripetal force:
   $$T = F_c = 12.5 \text{ N}$$
