### INTRODUCTION
Energy is a fundamental concept in physics that describes the capacity to do work. It exists in various forms, such as kinetic energy, potential energy, and thermal energy. Understanding energy is crucial for analyzing physical systems and solving real-world problems.

*Different forms of energy and their transformations*

## Definition of Energy

Energy is the capacity to do work. It is a scalar quantity, meaning it has magnitude but no direction. The SI unit of energy is the **Joule (J)**, where:

$$
1 \text{ J} = 1 \text{ N} \cdot \text{m}
$$

## Types of Energy

### 1. Kinetic Energy (KE)

Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. It depends on the mass and velocity of an object:

![Kinetic Energy](/images/physics/work-energy/kinetic-energy.svg)
*Kinetic energy increases with both mass and velocity (squared)*

$$
KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
$$

where:
- $m$ = mass of the object (in kg)
- $v$ = velocity of the object (in m/s)

**Example**: A moving car has kinetic energy due to its motion.

### 2. Potential Energy (PE)

Potential energy is the energy stored in an object due to its position or configuration. There are two main types:

#### a. Gravitational Potential Energy

Energy stored in an object due to its height above a reference point:

![Gravitational Potential Energy](/images/physics/work-energy/gravitational-potential-energy.svg)
*Gravitational potential energy depends on height above a reference point*

$$
PE_{\text{grav}} = m g h
$$

where:
- $m$ = mass of the object (in kg)
- $g$ = acceleration due to gravity ($9.81 \text{ m/s}^2$)
- $h$ = height above the reference point (in m)

**Example**: A book on a shelf has gravitational potential energy.

#### b. Elastic Potential Energy

Energy stored in elastic objects when stretched or compressed:

![Elastic Potential Energy](/images/physics/work-energy/elastic-potential-energy.svg)
*Elastic potential energy in a spring system*

$$
PE_{\text{elastic}} = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
$$

where:
- $k$ = spring constant (in N/m)
- $x$ = displacement from equilibrium (in m)

**Example**: A compressed spring has elastic potential energy.

### 3. Mechanical Energy

The sum of kinetic and potential energy:

![Mechanical Energy](/images/physics/work-energy/mechanical-energy.svg)
*Conservation of mechanical energy in a pendulum system*

$$
E_{\text{mech}} = KE + PE
$$

## Conservation of Energy

Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. In an isolated system:

![Work-Energy Theorem](/images/physics/work-energy/work-energy-theorem.svg)
*The work-energy theorem shows how work changes an object's energy*

$$
E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}}
$$

## Real-World Examples

1. **Roller Coaster**: At the top of a hill, a roller coaster has maximum potential energy and minimum kinetic energy. As it descends, potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.

2. **Pendulum**: A swinging pendulum continuously converts potential energy into kinetic energy and vice versa.

3. **Spring**: When a spring is compressed, it stores elastic potential energy. When released, this energy is converted into kinetic energy.

4. **Hydroelectric Dam**: Water at a height has gravitational potential energy, which is converted into kinetic energy as it falls, and then into electrical energy by turbines.

## Common Misconceptions

1. **Energy is a Substance**: Energy is not a physical substance but a property of a system that allows it to do work.

2. **Energy is Always Conserved in Open Systems**: Energy is only conserved in isolated systems. In open systems, energy can be transferred to or from the surroundings.

3. **Kinetic and Potential Energy are Independent**: Kinetic and potential energy are interrelated and can be converted into each other.

4. **Energy is the Same as Power**: Energy is the capacity to do work, while power is the rate at which energy is transferred or work is done.

## Equations of Energy

1. **Kinetic Energy**:
   $$
   KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
   $$

2. **Gravitational Potential Energy**:
   $$
   PE_{\text{grav}} = m g h
   $$

3. **Elastic Potential Energy**:
   $$
   PE_{\text{elastic}} = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
   $$

4. **Mechanical Energy**:
   $$
   E_{\text{mech}} = KE + PE
   $$

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Kinetic Energy

![Kinetic Energy Problems](/images/physics/work-energy/ke-problem.svg)
*Examples of objects with different masses and velocities for kinetic energy calculations*

**Problem 1.1**: A 5 kg object is moving at 12 m/s. What is its kinetic energy?

**Solution**:
$$
KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \text{ kg} \times (12 \text{ m/s})^2 = 360 \text{ J}
$$

**Problem 1.2**: A car's kinetic energy increases by 200,000 J when it accelerates from 15 m/s to 25 m/s. What is the mass of the car?

**Solution**:
Using change in kinetic energy:
$$\Delta KE = \frac{1}{2}m(v_f^2 - v_i^2)$$
$$200,000 = \frac{1}{2}m(25^2 - 15^2)$$
$$200,000 = \frac{1}{2}m(625 - 225)$$
$$200,000 = 200m$$
$$m = 1,000 \text{ kg}$$

**Problem 1.3**: A bullet of mass 10 g has a kinetic energy of 2000 J. Calculate its velocity.

**Solution**:
$$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
$$2000 = \frac{1}{2}(0.01)v^2$$
$$v = \sqrt{\frac{4000}{0.01}} = 632.46 \text{ m/s}$$

### Problem 2: Gravitational Potential Energy

**Problem 2.1**: A 10 kg object is lifted to a height of 5 meters. What is its gravitational potential energy? (Assume $g = 9.81 \text{ m/s}^2$)

**Solution**:
$$
PE_{\text{grav}} = m g h = 10 \text{ kg} \times 9.81 \text{ m/s}^2 \times 5 \text{ m} = 490.5 \text{ J}
$$

**Problem 2.2**: A water reservoir contains 1 million kg of water at a height of 50 meters. Calculate its potential energy and the theoretical maximum electrical energy it could generate.

**Solution**:
$$PE = mgh = 1,000,000 \times 9.81 \times 50 = 490,500,000 \text{ J}$$
Assuming 100% efficiency (theoretical):
$$E_{electrical} = 490.5 \text{ MJ} = 136.25 \text{ kWh}$$

**Problem 2.3**: At what height would a 2 kg book need to be placed to have the same gravitational potential energy as a 5 kg ball at 3 meters height?

**Solution**:
$$m_1gh_1 = m_2gh_2$$
$$5 \times 9.81 \times 3 = 2 \times 9.81 \times h$$
$$h = \frac{5 \times 3}{2} = 7.5 \text{ meters}$$

### Problem 3: Elastic Potential Energy

**Problem 3.1**: A spring with a spring constant of 400 N/m is compressed by 0.2 meters. What is its elastic potential energy?

**Solution**:
$$
PE_{\text{elastic}} = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 \text{ N/m} \times (0.2 \text{ m})^2 = 8 \text{ J}
$$

**Problem 3.2**: Two identical springs with spring constant 300 N/m are connected in series and compressed by 0.15 meters. Calculate the total elastic potential energy stored.

**Solution**:
Effective spring constant for series springs:
$$k_{eff} = \frac{k}{2} = 150 \text{ N/m}$$
Elastic potential energy:
$$PE = \frac{1}{2}k_{eff}x^2 = \frac{1}{2}(150)(0.15)^2 = 1.69 \text{ J}$$

**Problem 3.3**: A spring requires 50 J of energy to stretch it by 0.25 meters. What is its spring constant?

**Solution**:
$$PE = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
$$50 = \frac{1}{2}k(0.25)^2$$
$$k = \frac{100}{0.0625} = 1600 \text{ N/m}$$

### Problem 4: Conservation of Energy

![Conservation of Energy Problems](/images/physics/work-energy/conservation-problem.svg)
*Various scenarios demonstrating conservation of energy: falling object, pendulum, and roller coaster*

**Problem 4.1**: A 2 kg object is dropped from a height of 10 meters. What is its velocity just before it hits the ground? (Assume $g = 9.81 \text{ m/s}^2$)

**Solution**:
Using conservation of energy:
$$PE_{\text{initial}} = KE_{\text{final}}$$
$$mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
$$v = \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2 \times 9.81 \times 10} \approx 14 \text{ m/s}$$

**Problem 4.2**: A pendulum bob of mass 0.5 kg swings from a height of 0.2 meters. Calculate its velocity at the lowest point.

**Solution**:
Using conservation of energy:
$$PE_{initial} = KE_{final}$$
$$mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
$$v = \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2 \times 9.81 \times 0.2} = 1.98 \text{ m/s}$$

**Problem 4.3**: A roller coaster car of mass 1000 kg starts from rest at a height of 50 meters. If it loses 20% of its energy to friction, what is its speed at a height of 20 meters?

**Solution**:
Initial energy:
$$E_i = mgh_i = 1000 \times 9.81 \times 50 = 490,500 \text{ J}$$
Energy after 20% loss:
$$E_f = 0.8 \times 490,500 = 392,400 \text{ J}$$
At height 20 m:
$$392,400 = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + mgh_f$$
$$392,400 = 500v^2 + 196,200$$
$$v = \sqrt{\frac{196,200}{500}} = 19.8 \text{ m/s}$$

### Problem 5: Mechanical Energy

**Problem 5.1**: A 3 kg object is moving at 8 m/s at a height of 4 meters. What is its total mechanical energy? (Assume $g = 9.81 \text{ m/s}^2$)

**Solution**:
$$E_{\text{mech}} = KE + PE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + mgh$$
$$E_{\text{mech}} = \frac{1}{2}(3)(8)^2 + 3(9.81)(4)$$
$$E_{\text{mech}} = 96 + 117.72 = 213.72 \text{ J}$$

**Problem 5.2**: A 0.2 kg ball is thrown horizontally at 15 m/s from a height of 25 meters. Calculate its total mechanical energy and the time it takes to reach the ground.

**Solution**:
Initial mechanical energy:
$$E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + mgh = \frac{1}{2}(0.2)(15)^2 + 0.2(9.81)(25)$$
$$E = 22.5 + 49.05 = 71.55 \text{ J}$$
Time to ground (using kinematics):
$$y = \frac{1}{2}gt^2$$
$$25 = \frac{1}{2}(9.81)t^2$$
$$t = \sqrt{\frac{50}{9.81}} = 2.26 \text{ seconds}$$

**Problem 5.3**: A spring-mass system consists of a 0.5 kg mass on a spring with k = 200 N/m. If the mass is oscillating with amplitude 0.1 m, find the total mechanical energy at any point.

**Solution**:
Maximum potential energy (at maximum displacement):
$$PE_{max} = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \frac{1}{2}(200)(0.1)^2 = 1 \text{ J}$$
Total mechanical energy (conserved):
$$E_{total} = 1 \text{ J}$$

### Problem 6: Energy Transformation

**Problem 6.1**: A 1 kg object is thrown vertically upward with an initial velocity of 20 m/s. What is its maximum height? (Assume $g = 9.81 \text{ m/s}^2$)

**Solution**:
$$KE_{\text{initial}} = PE_{\text{final}}$$
$$\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = mgh$$
$$h = \frac{v^2}{2g} = \frac{400}{19.62} = 20.4 \text{ m}$$

**Problem 6.2**: A 50 g arrow is shot from a bow that has an elastic potential energy of 100 J. If 80% of the energy is transferred to the arrow, what is its velocity?

**Solution**:
Energy transferred to arrow:
$$KE = 0.8 \times 100 = 80 \text{ J}$$
$$80 = \frac{1}{2}(0.05)v^2$$
$$v = \sqrt{\frac{160}{0.05}} = 56.57 \text{ m/s}$$

**Problem 6.3**: A 2 kg block slides down a frictionless inclined plane of height 3 m. At what point along the incline will its speed be 5 m/s?

**Solution**:
Using conservation of energy:
$$mgh_1 = mgh_2 + \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
$$2(9.81)(3) = 2(9.81)h_2 + \frac{1}{2}(2)(5)^2$$
$$58.86 = 19.62h_2 + 25$$
$$h_2 = 1.73 \text{ meters}$$

### Problem 7: Elastic Potential Energy to Kinetic Energy

![Spring-Mass System](/images/physics/work-energy/spring-mass-problem.svg)
*Spring-mass system showing compression and subsequent release*

**Problem 7.1**: A spring with a spring constant of 500 N/m is compressed by 0.1 meters and then released. What is the maximum velocity of a 2 kg object attached to the spring?

**Solution**:
$$PE_{\text{elastic}} = KE$$
$$\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
$$v = \sqrt{\frac{kx^2}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{500(0.1)^2}{2}} = 1.58 \text{ m/s}$$

**Problem 7.2**: Two springs with spring constants k₁ = 300 N/m and k₂ = 400 N/m are connected in parallel and compressed 0.2 m. What velocity will they give to a 1 kg mass?

**Solution**:
Combined spring constant:
$$k_{total} = k_1 + k_2 = 700 \text{ N/m}$$
Using energy conservation:
$$\frac{1}{2}k_{total}x^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
$$v = \sqrt{\frac{700(0.2)^2}{1}} = 5.29 \text{ m/s}$$

**Problem 7.3**: A 0.5 kg mass attached to a spring oscillates with amplitude 0.15 m. If its maximum speed is 2 m/s, what is the spring constant?

**Solution**:
Maximum KE equals maximum PE:
$$\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2$$
$$\frac{1}{2}(0.5)(2)^2 = \frac{1}{2}k(0.15)^2$$
$$k = \frac{1 \times 4}{0.0225} = 177.78 \text{ N/m}$$

### Problem 8: Energy Lost to Friction

**Problem 8.1**: A 5 kg object slides down a ramp from a height of 3 meters. If the object reaches the bottom with a velocity of 4 m/s, how much energy was lost to friction? (Assume $g = 9.81 \text{ m/s}^2$)

**Solution**:
$$E_{\text{initial}} = mgh = 5 \times 9.81 \times 3 = 147.15 \text{ J}$$
$$E_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 4^2 = 40 \text{ J}$$
$$E_{\text{lost}} = 147.15 - 40 = 107.15 \text{ J}$$

**Problem 8.2**: A 1000 kg car moving at 20 m/s applies its brakes and comes to a stop over a distance of 40 meters. Calculate the average friction force and the energy lost to heat.

**Solution**:
Initial kinetic energy:
$$KE_i = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}(1000)(20)^2 = 200,000 \text{ J}$$
Average friction force:
$$W = Fd = 200,000 \text{ J}$$
$$F = \frac{200,000}{40} = 5000 \text{ N}$$
Energy lost to heat = 200,000 J

**Problem 8.3**: A 2 kg block starts from rest at the top of a 30° incline that is 4 meters long. If it reaches the bottom with a speed of 5 m/s, what is the coefficient of kinetic friction?

**Solution**:
Initial potential energy:
$$h = 4\sin(30°) = 2 \text{ m}$$
$$PE_i = mgh = 2(9.81)(2) = 39.24 \text{ J}$$
Final kinetic energy:
$$KE_f = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}(2)(5)^2 = 25 \text{ J}$$
Energy lost to friction:
$$E_{lost} = 39.24 - 25 = 14.24 \text{ J}$$
Normal force:
$$N = mg\cos(30°) = 2(9.81)(0.866) = 17 \text{ N}$$
Using work-energy:
$$\mu Nd = 14.24$$
$$\mu = \frac{14.24}{17(4)} = 0.21$$
