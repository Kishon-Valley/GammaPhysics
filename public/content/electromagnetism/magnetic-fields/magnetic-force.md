## Magnetic Forces

Magnetic forces represent a fundamental interaction in nature that occurs between moving charged particles and magnetic fields. These forces drive the operation of countless technological devices, from simple electric motors to sophisticated particle accelerators, and play a crucial role in many natural phenomena.

### The Lorentz Force Law

When a charged particle moves through a magnetic field, it experiences a force known as the Lorentz force. This force depends on the particle's charge, its velocity, and the magnetic field strength, as illustrated below:

![Lorentz Force Law visualization](/content/images/electromagnetism/magnetic-fields/lorentz-force.svg)

The mathematical expression that describes this interaction is:

$\vec{F} = q\vec{v} × \vec{B}$

The cross product in this equation reveals a fundamental characteristic of magnetic forces: they act perpendicular to both the velocity and magnetic field vectors. The magnitude of this force is given by:

$F = |q|vB\sin\theta$

where θ represents the angle between the velocity and magnetic field vectors. This relationship explains why a charged particle moving parallel to a magnetic field experiences no magnetic force, while one moving perpendicular to the field experiences maximum force.

### Charged Particle Motion in Magnetic Fields

The perpendicular orientation of the magnetic force relative to both the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field results in characteristic particle trajectories. 

When a charged particle enters a magnetic field with velocity perpendicular to the field, it follows a circular path. The radius of this circle, determined by the balance between magnetic force and centripetal force, is:

$r = \frac{mv}{|q|B}$

The particle completes these circular orbits with a frequency known as the cyclotron frequency:

$f = \frac{|q|B}{2πm}$

This frequency depends only on the particle's charge-to-mass ratio and the magnetic field strength, making it useful for particle identification in mass spectrometers.

When a particle enters a magnetic field at an angle, it combines circular motion perpendicular to the field with constant velocity parallel to the field. The result is a helical path, resembling a spring coiled around the magnetic field lines, as shown below:

![Helical motion of a charged particle in magnetic field](/content/images/electromagnetism/magnetic-fields/helical-motion.svg)

This motion explains many natural phenomena, such as the spiraling of cosmic rays in Earth's magnetic field.

### Forces on Current-Carrying Conductors

The interaction between current-carrying conductors and magnetic fields represents one of the most significant practical applications of electromagnetic forces. When electric current flows through a conductor, it creates a stream of moving charges that interact with any present magnetic field, resulting in a force that follows precise mathematical relationships.

For a straight conductor placed in a magnetic field, the magnetic force manifests as a distributed force along the conductor's length. The differential force $d\vec{F}$ on an infinitesimal length element $d\vec{l}$ carrying current I in a magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is given by:

$\frac{d\vec{F}}{dl} = I\vec{l} × \vec{B}$

The magnitude of this force per unit length depends on the current strength, magnetic field intensity, and the sine of the angle θ between the conductor and the field:

$\frac{dF}{dl} = IB\sin θ$

To determine the total force on a finite conductor segment, we must integrate over its entire length:

$\vec{F} = I\int d\vec{l} × \vec{B}$

For a straight conductor of length L in a uniform magnetic field, this simplifies to:

$F = ILB\sin θ$

When the conductor forms a closed loop, the magnetic forces create a torque that tends to rotate the loop. For a rectangular loop with N turns, carrying current I, with area A, in a uniform magnetic field B, the torque τ is:

$τ = NIAB\sin θ$

The potential energy U of the current loop in the magnetic field varies with orientation:

$U = -NIAB\cos θ$

This relationship explains why current loops seek to align themselves with the magnetic field to minimize their potential energy.

### Practical Applications in Electromagnetic Devices

Electric motors exemplify the practical application of these principles. In a DC motor, current flows through multiple coils wound around a rotating armature within a permanent magnetic field. The magnetic force on these current-carrying conductors creates a torque that produces continuous rotation. The instantaneous power output P of the motor relates to the torque and angular velocity ω:

$P = τω = NIAB\sin θ \cdot ω$

The average power output over one complete rotation is:

$P_{avg} = \frac{NIAB}{2π}\int_0^{2π} \sin θ \cdot dθ$

The efficiency η of the motor can be calculated as the ratio of mechanical power output to electrical power input:

$η = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}} = \frac{τω}{VI}$

where V is the applied voltage.

In electromagnetic propulsion systems, the force on current-carrying conductors drives linear motion. The thrust F produced by a propulsion system with multiple conductor loops is:

$F = nILB$

where n is the number of conductor loops, each of length L.

Mass spectrometers utilize these magnetic forces for precise particle analysis. When charged particles with mass m and charge q enter a magnetic field with velocity v, they follow circular paths with radius r given by:

$r = \frac{mv}{qB}$

The mass-to-charge ratio can then be determined from:

$\frac{m}{q} = \frac{rB}{v}$

This principle enables the separation and identification of ions based on their mass-to-charge ratios, with resolution δm/m given by:

$\frac{δm}{m} = 2\frac{δr}{r}$

### Advanced Applications and Considerations

In superconducting magnets, the force between current-carrying conductors becomes particularly significant. The force per unit length between two parallel conductors carrying currents I₁ and I₂, separated by distance d, is:

$\frac{F}{L} = \frac{μ_0I_1I_2}{2πd}$

This force is attractive when the currents flow in the same direction and repulsive when they flow in opposite directions. The magnetic pressure p exerted by a magnetic field of strength B is:

$p = \frac{B^2}{2μ_0}$

In practical applications, conductors must be designed to withstand these magnetic pressures, particularly in high-field applications like fusion reactors and particle accelerators.

### Magnetic Force Applications

Electric motors exemplify the practical application of magnetic forces. In a DC motor, current flows through coils mounted on a rotating armature. The magnetic force on these current-carrying conductors creates a torque, causing continuous rotation. The motor's power output depends on both the torque and angular velocity:

$P = τω$

Mass spectrometers utilize magnetic forces to separate ions based on their mass-to-charge ratios. Ions accelerated to the same velocity enter a magnetic field, where they follow circular paths of different radii depending on their masses. This principle enables precise mass determination of atomic and molecular species.

### Practice Problems

#### Problem 1: Particle Accelerator Design
A particle accelerator needs to bend a beam of protons (mass = 1.67 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) with kinetic energy 2.0 MeV into a circular path of radius 0.75 m. Calculate the required magnetic field strength.

Solution:
First, find the velocity from kinetic energy:
$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
$2.0 \text{ MeV} = 3.2 × 10^{-13} \text{ J}$
$v = \sqrt{\frac{2(3.2 × 10^{-13})}{1.67 × 10^{-27}}} = 1.96 × 10^7 \text{ m/s}$

Then use the radius equation:
$B = \frac{mv}{qr} = \frac{(1.67 × 10^{-27})(1.96 × 10^7)}{(1.6 × 10^{-19})(0.75)} = 0.27 \text{ T}$

$τ_{max} = NIAB = (200)(1.5)(0.03^2)(0.45) = 0.12 \text{ N}\cdot\text{m}$

Angular velocity:
$ω = \frac{2π(3000)}{60} = 314.2 \text{ rad/s}$

Power output:
$P = τω = (0.12)(314.2) = 37.7 \text{ W}$

In a mass spectrometer, singly charged ions enter a 0.35 T magnetic field with velocity 4.5 × 10⁵ m/s. Two ion paths differ by 3.0 cm in radius. Find the mass difference between the ions.

Solution:
Using $r = \frac{mv}{qB}$:
$Δm = \frac{qBΔr}{v} = \frac{(1.6 × 10^{-19})(0.35)(0.03)}{4.5 × 10^5} = 3.73 × 10^{-26} \text{ kg}$
This corresponds to approximately 22.5 atomic mass units.

#### Problem 5: Particle Trajectory
An electron (mass = 9.11 × 10⁻³¹ kg) enters a 1.2 T magnetic field with velocity 2.0 × 10⁷ m/s at 30° to the field. Calculate:

Solution:
Radius of helical path:
$r = \frac{mv\sin\theta}{qB} = \frac{(9.11 × 10^{-31})(2.0 × 10^7)\sin(30°)}{(1.6 × 10^{-19})(1.2)} = 4.77 × 10^{-4} \text{ m}$

Pitch of helix:
$p = \frac{2πmv\cos\theta}{qB} = \frac{2π(9.11 × 10^{-31})(2.0 × 10^7)\cos(30°)}{(1.6 × 10^{-19})(1.2)} = 5.17 × 10^{-3} \text{ m}$

These calculations demonstrate how magnetic forces control particle motion in various practical applications, from particle physics to industrial motors.

Solution:
Maximum torque:
$τ_{max} = NIAB = (200)(2.0)(0.004)(0.5) = 0.8 \text{ N}\cdot\text{m}$

Angular velocity:
$ω = \frac{2π(3000)}{60} = 314.16 \text{ rad/s}$

Power output:
$P = τω = (0.8)(314.16) = 251.33 \text{ W}$

2. Electromagnetic Force Calculation

Solution:
Force:
$F = ILB = (5.0)(0.3)(1.2) = 1.8 \text{ N}$

Work done:
$W = Fd = (1.8)(0.1) = 0.18 \text{ J}$

These calculations demonstrate the practical application of magnetic forces in electromagnetic devices and highlight the importance of understanding these principles for engineering design and analysis.
