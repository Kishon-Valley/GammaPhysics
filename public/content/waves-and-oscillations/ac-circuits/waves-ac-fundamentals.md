## Resonance in RLC Circuits

In series RLC circuits, resonance occurs when the inductive reactance and capacitive reactance are equal in magnitude but opposite in phase, effectively canceling each other out. 

At the resonant frequency, the circuit impedance is purely resistive and at its minimum value:

$$f_0 = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}$$

Where:
- $f_0$ is the resonant frequency in Hz
- $L$ is the inductance in henries
- $C$ is the capacitance in farads

The following interactive animation demonstrates how circuit impedance and phase angle vary with frequency. Note how at resonance, the impedance reaches its minimum value and the phase angle passes through zero:

The resonance phenomenon has many practical applications:
- Radio and television tuners
- Bandpass filters
- Wireless power transfer systems
- Impedance matching networks
