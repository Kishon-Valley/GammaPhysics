Understanding wave propagation and interference is essential for designing soundproofing materials and noise control systems. Techniques include:  
- **Absorption**: Using porous materials to absorb sound waves.  
- **Damping**: Reducing vibrations in structures to minimize sound transmission.  
- **Active Noise Cancellation**: Using destructive interference to cancel out unwanted sound waves.  

### **3. Ultrasound Imaging**  
Ultrasound technology uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of internal body structures. Applications include:  
- **Medical Diagnostics**: Imaging organs, tissues, and blood flow.  
- **Prenatal Care**: Monitoring fetal development during pregnancy.
