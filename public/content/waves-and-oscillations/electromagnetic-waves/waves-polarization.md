## Electromagnetic Waves: Polarization  
*Understanding the Orientation of Electric Fields*  

---

### **Introduction to Polarization**  
Polarization is a fundamental property of electromagnetic (EM) waves that describes the orientation of the electric field vector as the wave propagates. While the magnetic field is always perpendicular to the electric field, the electric field itself can oscillate in specific directions or patterns. Polarization has significant implications in optics, communication, and imaging, as it affects how light interacts with materials and devices.

## **Types of Polarization**  
### **Linear Polarization**  
In **linearly polarized** light, the electric field oscillates in a single plane. For example, if the electric field oscillates vertically, the light is vertically polarized. Mathematically, the electric field can be written as:  
$$
\mathbf{E}(z, t) = E_0 \cos(kz - \omega t) \, \hat{\mathbf{x}}
$$  
where $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ is the unit vector in the $x$-direction.

### **Circular Polarization**  
In **circularly polarized** light, the electric field vector rotates in a circular pattern as the wave propagates. There are two types:  
1. **Right-Hand Circular Polarization (RHCP)**: The electric field rotates clockwise as viewed from the receiver.  
2. **Left-Hand Circular Polarization (LHCP)**: The electric field rotates counterclockwise.  

The electric field for RHCP can be expressed as:  
$$
\mathbf{E}(z, t) = E_0 \cos(kz - \omega t) \, \hat{\mathbf{x}} + E_0 \sin(kz - \omega t) \, \hat{\mathbf{y}}
$$

### **Elliptical Polarization**  
In **elliptically polarized** light, the electric field traces out an ellipse. This is the most general form of polarization and includes linear and circular polarization as special cases.

## **Mathematical Description of Polarization**  
### **Jones Vector Representation**  
The polarization state of light can be described using the **Jones vector**, a two-component complex vector:  
$$
\mathbf{J} = \begin{pmatrix} E_x e^{i\phi_x} \\ E_y e^{i\phi_y} \end{pmatrix}
$$  
Here, $E_x$ and $E_y$ are the amplitudes of the electric field in the $x$- and $y$-directions, and $\phi_x$ and $\phi_y$ are their respective phases.  

#### **Examples of Jones Vectors**  
1. **Horizontal Polarization**:  
   $$
   \mathbf{J} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
   $$  
2. **Vertical Polarization**:  
   $$
   \mathbf{J} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
   $$  
3. **Right-Hand Circular Polarization**:  
   $$
   \mathbf{J} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -i \end{pmatrix}
   $$  

### **Stokes Parameters**  
For partially polarized light, the **Stokes parameters** provide a complete description:  
1. $S_0$: Total intensity.  
2. $S_1$: Difference in intensity between horizontal and vertical polarization.  
3. $S_2$: Difference in intensity between $+45^\circ$ and $-45^\circ$ polarization.  
4. $S_3$: Difference in intensity between RHCP and LHCP.

## Polarization Applications and Implementations

### Polarizer Mechanisms and Characteristics

Polarizers are optical devices that convert unpolarized electromagnetic radiation into defined polarization states. Two primary types are utilized in applications:

**Wire-grid polarizers**: Metallic conducting elements with sub-wavelength spacing selectively reflect one polarization while transmitting the orthogonal component.

**Dichroic polarizers**: Utilize anisotropic absorption in oriented molecular structures to achieve selective transmission of specific polarization states.

Polarizer performance is characterized by the extinction ratio (ER), defined as the ratio of maximum to minimum transmission intensities:

ER = $T_{max}/T_{min}$

### Malus's Law

The transmission of linearly polarized light through a linear polarizer follows Malus's Law:

$$
I = I_0\cos^2\theta
$$

where $I_0$ is incident intensity, $I$ is transmitted intensity, and $\theta$ is the angle between incident polarization and polarizer transmission axis. Maximum transmission occurs at $\theta = 0°$ and minimum at $\theta = 90°$.

### Phase Retardation Devices

Wave plates utilize birefringence to modify polarization states through phase retardation between orthogonal field components:

Quarter-wave plates: Introduce $\pi/2$ phase retardation, converting linear to circular polarization
Half-wave plates: Introduce $\pi$ phase retardation, rotating linear polarization

The phase retardation $\Gamma$ is wavelength-dependent:

$$
\Gamma = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}(n_e - n_o)d
$$

where $d$ is plate thickness and $(n_e - n_o)$ is the birefringence.

### Technical Applications

Display Technology:
Liquid crystal displays utilize polarizer pairs with switchable liquid crystal layers
Polarization rotation controls pixel transmission states

Optical Communication:
Polarization-maintaining fibers preserve signal states
Optical isolators employ non-reciprocal polarization rotation

Measurement and Analysis:
Polarization microscopy enables analysis of molecular orientation
Photoelastic stress analysis utilizes stress-induced birefringence

Quantum Information:
Quantum key distribution protocols employ polarization encoding
Single-photon polarization states serve as quantum bits

## **Advanced Topics**  

### **Interface Polarization**  
When electromagnetic waves interact with interfaces between different media, specific polarization effects occur. At a dielectric interface like glass, the reflected and transmitted waves exhibit polarization states that depend on the incident angle. At Brewster's angle, the reflected wave becomes completely polarized parallel to the surface, due to the interaction between the wave's electric field and surface electrons.

![Brewster's Angle](/content/images/electromagnetism/polarization/brewsters_angle.svg)

Brewster's angle ($\theta_B$) is determined by the relationship between the angle of incidence ($\theta_i$) and the refractive indices:

$$
\tan(\theta_B) = \frac{n_2}{n_1}
$$

At this angle, the reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular, resulting in reflection of only light polarized parallel to the surface. This principle is applied in polarizing filters to reduce glare from surfaces.

### **Polarization by Molecular Scattering**  
Atmospheric polarization occurs through molecular scattering of sunlight. This process, known as Rayleigh scattering, produces polarized light with maximum polarization at 90 degrees from the incident direction.

The scattered light intensity is described by Rayleigh's law:

$$
I(\theta) = I_0 \frac{1 + \cos^2(\theta)}{2R^2}
$$

where $\theta$ is the scattering angle and $R$ is the distance to the scattering center.

### **Quantum Mechanical Polarization**  
In quantum mechanics, polarization is described by quantum states. Individual photons can exist in superposition states of different polarizations. Measurement of a photon's polarization causes the wavefunction to collapse into a definite state.

A photon's polarization state can be expressed as:

$$
|\psi\rangle = \alpha|H\rangle + \beta|V\rangle
$$

where $|H\rangle$ and $|V\rangle$ represent horizontal and vertical polarization states, with complex coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta$ satisfying $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$. This quantum description enables applications in quantum cryptography through polarization-encoded photons.

### **Electromagnetic Wave Momentum in Matter**

The momentum of electromagnetic waves in material media exhibits distinct behavior depending on the theoretical framework. Two primary formulations exist for photon momentum in dielectric media:

Minkowski momentum:
$$
p_M = \frac{n\hbar\omega}{c}
$$

Abraham momentum:
$$
p_A = \frac{\hbar\omega}{nc}
$$

These formulations represent different physical aspects: Minkowski momentum corresponds to canonical momentum, while Abraham momentum represents the combined mechanical momentum of light and matter.

### **Quantum Properties of Electromagnetic Waves**

Quantum electrodynamics describes electromagnetic waves through discrete energy and momentum values:

$$
E = \hbar\omega, \quad p = \frac{\hbar\omega}{c}
$$

These relations define the quantum properties of photons. In QED, photon-electron interactions produce effects such as the Lamb shift and spontaneous emission. Quantum entanglement of photon polarization states enables quantum information applications, including cryptography and quantum state teleportation.

### **Practice Problems: Advanced Electromagnetic Wave Concepts**

#### Problem 1: Wave Momentum in Dielectrics
Light with wavelength 500 nm enters a glass medium with refractive index n = 1.5. Calculate:
a) The photon momentum in vacuum
b) The Minkowski momentum in the glass
c) The Abraham momentum in the glass

**Solution:**
a) Vacuum momentum:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   p &= \frac{h}{\lambda} \\
   &= \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{500 \times 10^{-9}} \\
   &= 1.325 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg⋅m/s}
   \end{aligned}
   $$

b) Minkowski momentum:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   p_M &= np_{vacuum} \\
   &= 1.5 \times 1.325 \times 10^{-27} \\
   &= 1.988 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg⋅m/s}
   \end{aligned}
   $$

c) Abraham momentum:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   p_A &= \frac{p_{vacuum}}{n} \\
   &= \frac{1.325 \times 10^{-27}}{1.5} \\
   &= 8.833 \times 10^{-28} \text{ kg⋅m/s}
   \end{aligned}
   $$

#### Problem 2: Quantum State Evolution
A photon is prepared in the state:
$$
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|H\rangle + e^{i\phi}|V\rangle)
$$
where φ changes with time as φ = ωt. Determine:
a) The probability of measuring horizontal polarization
b) The time evolution of the expectation value of the Stokes operator S₁

**Solution:**
a) The probability is time-independent:
   $$
   P(H) = |\langle H|\psi\rangle|^2 = \frac{1}{2}
   $$

b) The expectation value oscillates:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   \langle S_1 \rangle &= \cos(\phi) \\
   &= \cos(\omega t)
   \end{aligned}
   $$

#### Problem 3: Quantum Interference
Two photons with parallel polarization interfere at a 50:50 beam splitter. Calculate:
a) The probability of both photons emerging from the same output port
b) The visibility of the interference pattern if the photons are distinguishable in frequency

**Solution:**
a) For indistinguishable photons:
   $$
   P_{same} = \frac{1}{2}(1 + |\gamma|^2)
   $$
   where γ = 1 for perfectly indistinguishable photons, giving P_{same} = 1

b) For partially distinguishable photons:
   $$
   V = |\gamma| = e^{-(\Delta\omega)^2/(4\sigma^2)}
   $$
   where Δω is the frequency difference and σ is the spectral width

These problems illustrate the rich interplay between classical and quantum aspects of electromagnetic waves, challenging students to connect mathematical formalism with physical reality.

## **Practice Problems and Solutions**  

### Problem 1: Brewster's Angle  
Light travels from air ($n_1 = 1.00$) into a transparent material. When the angle of incidence is 57°, the reflected light is completely polarized. Calculate:
a) The index of refraction of the material
b) The angle of refraction at this incidence angle

**Solution:**
a) At Brewster's angle ($\theta_B = 57°$):
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   \tan(\theta_B) &= \frac{n_2}{n_1} \\
   \tan(57°) &= \frac{n_2}{1.00} \\
   n_2 &= 1.54
   \end{aligned}
   $$
   This is close to the refractive index of crown glass.

b) Using Snell's law:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   n_1\sin(\theta_1) &= n_2\sin(\theta_2) \\
   1.00\sin(57°) &= 1.54\sin(\theta_2) \\
   \theta_2 &= 33°
   \end{aligned}
   $$
   Note that at Brewster's angle, $\theta_1 + \theta_2 = 90°$, which we can verify: $57° + 33° = 90°$

### Problem 2: Malus's Law and Polarizer Chains  
Three polarizers are arranged in sequence. The first and third are oriented vertically, while the middle one is rotated by an angle θ from vertical. If unpolarized light of intensity $I_0 = 100$ W/m² is incident on this arrangement:
a) What is the intensity after the first polarizer?
b) Find the angle θ that maximizes the final intensity
c) Calculate this maximum intensity

**Solution:**
a) For unpolarized light through first polarizer:
   $$
   I_1 = \frac{I_0}{2} = 50 \text{ W/m²}
   $$

b) After all three polarizers:
   $$
   I_3 = I_0(\frac{1}{2})\cos^2(\theta)\cos^2(\theta)
   $$
   To maximize, take derivative with respect to θ and set to zero:
   $$
   \frac{d}{d\theta}[\cos^4(\theta)] = 0
   $$
   This occurs at θ = 45°

c) Maximum intensity:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   I_{3,max} &= 50\cos^2(45°)\cos^2(45°) \\
   &= 50(\frac{1}{2})^2 \\
   &= 12.5 \text{ W/m²}
   \end{aligned}
   $$

### Problem 3: Quantum Polarization States  
A photon is prepared in the state:
$$
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}|H\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}|V\rangle
$$
a) What is the probability of measuring horizontal polarization?
b) If this measurement is made and yields horizontal polarization, what is the state after measurement?
c) What angle should a polarizer be oriented at to have a 75% chance of transmitting this photon?

**Solution:**
a) Probability of horizontal polarization:
   $$
   P(H) = |\langle H|\psi\rangle|^2 = |\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}|^2 = \frac{1}{3}
   $$

b) After measuring horizontal polarization, the state collapses to:
   $$
   |\psi'\rangle = |H\rangle
   $$

c) For a polarizer at angle θ:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   P(\theta) &= |\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\cos(\theta) + \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\sin(\theta)|^2 = 0.75 \\
   \theta &= 63.4°
   \end{aligned}
   $$

### Problem 4: Polarization in Fiber Optics  
A fiber optic cable exhibits polarization mode dispersion with a differential group delay of 0.5 ps/km. For a 40 km link carrying 10 Gbps data:
a) Calculate the total time spread of pulses
b) What is the maximum theoretical data rate to avoid intersymbol interference?

**Solution:**
a) Total time spread:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   \Delta t &= 0.5 \text{ ps/km} \times 40 \text{ km} \\
   &= 20 \text{ ps}
   \end{aligned}
   $$

b) Maximum data rate to avoid interference (assuming NRZ coding):
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   R_{max} &= \frac{1}{2\Delta t} \\
   &= \frac{1}{2 \times 20 \times 10^{-12}} \\
   &= 25 \text{ Gbps}
   \end{aligned}
   $$
   The current 10 Gbps rate is therefore safe from intersymbol interference.

These problems demonstrate practical applications of polarization concepts in optics, quantum mechanics, and telecommunications. They require understanding of:
- Brewster's angle and Snell's law
- Multiple polarizer interactions
- Quantum measurement and probability
- Polarization effects in optical communications
