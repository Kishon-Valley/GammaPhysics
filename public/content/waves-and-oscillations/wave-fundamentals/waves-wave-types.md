## Wave Fundamentals: Types of Waves

### Introduction to Waves
A **wave** is a physical phenomenon characterized by the propagation of energy and momentum through space and time, described by a wave function ψ(x,t). The propagation occurs via oscillations in a medium or field, maintaining the medium's equilibrium position while facilitating energy transport. The wave function satisfies the wave equation:

$\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial t^2} = v^2\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial x^2}$

where v represents the wave propagation velocity. This mathematical framework applies universally across multiple physical systems:

1. Mechanical oscillations in elastic media (sound waves)
2. Electromagnetic field oscillations (light, radio waves)
3. Quantum mechanical probability waves (matter waves)
4. Seismic propagation in elastic solids

The study of waves is fundamental to modern physics, as wave mechanics underlies:
- Energy and information transmission
- Quantum mechanical behavior
- Field theory formulations
- Wave-particle duality



### Classification of Waves
The study of waves in physics reveals three fundamental categories based on their interaction with the propagation medium. This classification provides deep insights into the nature of energy and momentum transfer across different physical systems.

## 1. **Medium Dependency**

### Mechanical Waves
In classical physics, mechanical waves demonstrate the fundamental principles of energy propagation through material media. The wave equation governing this motion,

$\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial t^2} = c^2\nabla^2\psi$

derives from Newton's laws and the elastic properties of the medium. Consider a sound wave propagating through air: the wave speed $v$ depends on the medium's bulk modulus $B$ and density $\rho$:

$v = \sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}}$

This relationship extends to various mechanical systems. For a vibrating string under tension $T$ with linear mass density $\mu$, the wave speed becomes:

$v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$

The energy transport mechanism in mechanical waves involves coordinated particle oscillations. Each particle executes simple harmonic motion about its equilibrium position, with displacement:

$x(t) = A\cos(\omega t + \phi)$

The energy density and power flow in the wave are quantified by:

Energy density: $E = \frac{1}{2}\rho\omega^2A^2$
Power transmission: $P = \frac{1}{2}\rho v\omega^2A^2$

This mathematical framework explains phenomena from seismic waves in the Earth's crust to sound propagation in musical instruments.

### Electromagnetic Waves
Maxwell's unification of electricity and magnetism revealed the profound nature of electromagnetic waves. These waves emerge naturally from Maxwell's equations, particularly from the curl equations relating electric and magnetic fields:

$\nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial\vec{B}}{\partial t}$ (Faraday's law)
$\nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial\vec{E}}{\partial t}$ (Ampère-Maxwell law)

These equations lead to wave equations for both fields:

$\nabla^2\vec{E} = \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2\vec{E}}{\partial t^2}$

where $c = 1/\sqrt{\mu_0\epsilon_0} = 3 \times 10^8$ m/s represents the universal speed of light. Unlike mechanical waves, electromagnetic waves require no medium, propagating through vacuum with mutually perpendicular $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ fields.

The electromagnetic spectrum spans an enormous frequency range, from radio waves ($10^3$ Hz) to gamma rays ($10^{20}$ Hz). Each photon carries energy $E = h\nu$, demonstrating the quantum nature of electromagnetic radiation. In material media, the wave properties modify according to the refractive index $n = \sqrt{\epsilon_r\mu_r}$, affecting both phase and group velocities.

### Matter Waves
Quantum mechanics revolutionized our understanding of matter through de Broglie's hypothesis of wave-particle duality. The wave nature of matter emerges from the Schrödinger equation:

$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\psi + V\psi = i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t}$

This equation, combined with de Broglie's relations, establishes fundamental connections between particle and wave properties:

$\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{mv}$ (wavelength-momentum relation)
$E = h\nu = \hbar\omega$ (energy-frequency relation)

The wave function $\psi(\vec{r},t)$ provides a complete quantum mechanical description, with $|\psi|^2$ giving the probability density for finding the particle. The wave properties manifest in phenomena such as electron diffraction, where the wavelength:

$\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2meV}}$

allows for precise control in electron microscopy. For macroscopic objects, $\lambda$ becomes extremely small ($\lambda \propto 1/m$), explaining the transition to classical behavior. The quantum wavelength determines fundamental limits in nanotechnology and quantum devices, from scanning tunneling microscopes to quantum computers.

### Wave Behavior and Applications
The mathematical principles governing wave phenomena lead to important physical effects and technological applications. Consider wave superposition, described by the principle of linear superposition:

$\psi_{total} = \sum_i \psi_i$

This principle manifests in interference patterns, where phase differences determine the type of interference:
- Constructive: $\Delta\phi = 2\pi n$ $(n = 0,1,2,...)$
- Destructive: $\Delta\phi = \pi + 2\pi n$ $(n = 0,1,2,...)$

Standing waves, formed by counter-propagating waves, are described by:

$y(x,t) = 2A\sin(kx)\cos(\omega t)$

This leads to quantization conditions in bounded systems:
$\lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}$ $(n = 1,2,3,...)$

Applications span multiple domains:
1. Acoustics and Vibration Analysis
   - Architectural acoustics: $T_{60} = 0.161\frac{V}{\alpha S}$
   - Structural resonance: $f_n = \frac{n}{2L}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$

2. Electromagnetic Technology
   - Waveguides: $f_c = \frac{c}{2a}$ (cutoff frequency)
   - Optical fibers: $NA = \sqrt{n_1^2 - n_2^2}$

3. Quantum Applications
   - Electron microscopy resolution: $d_{min} \approx \frac{\lambda}{2NA}$
   - Quantum tunneling probability: $T \propto e^{-2\kappa L}$

Understanding the medium dependency of waves has profound practical implications. In seismology, different types of mechanical waves (P-waves and S-waves) propagate differently through Earth's layers, providing crucial information about our planet's internal structure. In telecommunications, electromagnetic waves' ability to travel through vacuum enables satellite communications and space exploration. In quantum technology, matter waves' properties are exploited in developing new types of sensors and computing devices.

The study of wave-medium relationships continues to yield new insights and applications, from advanced materials that can control wave propagation to quantum devices that harness the wave nature of matter. This understanding forms a cornerstone of modern physics and engineering, bridging classical and quantum descriptions of nature.

## 2. **Direction of Particle Oscillation**

### Direction of Particle Oscillation: Understanding Wave Motion Patterns

The way particles move in relation to a wave's direction of travel provides one of the most fundamental ways to classify waves. This classification reveals deep insights into wave behavior and helps explain numerous natural phenomena. The direction of particle oscillation relative to wave propagation creates three distinct categories: transverse waves, longitudinal waves, and surface waves. Each type exhibits unique characteristics and plays specific roles in nature and technology.

### Transverse Waves

Transverse waves represent perhaps the most visually intuitive form of wave motion. In these waves, particles of the medium oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, creating the familiar pattern of crests and troughs. Imagine a rope stretched horizontally and shaken up and down at one end—the resulting wave travels along the rope while each point moves vertically, perfectly exemplifying transverse motion.

![Transverse Wave](/content/waves-and-oscillations/wave-fundamentals/images/transverse-wave.svg)

The mathematical description of a simple transverse wave reveals its elegant simplicity:

$y(x,t) = A\sin(kx - \omega t + \phi)$

where $y$ represents the displacement from equilibrium, $A$ is the amplitude, $k$ is the wave number, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $\phi$ is the phase constant. This equation describes how each point in the medium oscillates sinusoidally about its equilibrium position.

A unique and crucial property of transverse waves is their ability to be polarized. Polarization occurs when the oscillations are confined to a specific plane. Light waves, being transverse electromagnetic waves, demonstrate this property beautifully—polarized sunglasses work by filtering out light waves oscillating in certain directions, reducing glare from reflective surfaces.

### Longitudinal Waves: The Parallel Pulse

Longitudinal waves present a fundamentally different mode of wave motion, where particles oscillate parallel to the direction of wave propagation. These waves manifest as alternating regions of compression and rarefaction within the medium. Sound waves in air is a perfect example — air molecules move back and forth along the same direction the sound travels.

![Longitudinal Wave](/content/waves-and-oscillations/wave-fundamentals/images/longitudinal-wave.svg)

The displacement in a longitudinal wave can be described mathematically as:

$s(x,t) = s_0\sin(kx - \omega t)$

where $s$ represents the displacement along the direction of propagation. Unlike transverse waves, longitudinal waves cannot be polarized because their oscillations are confined to one dimension—the direction of travel.

Sound waves in air demonstrate how longitudinal waves transmit energy through a medium. As molecules compress and expand, they create pressure variations that propagate through space. This mechanism explains why sound travels faster in materials with higher elastic moduli—the stronger the interparticle forces, the more quickly the disturbance propagates.

### Surface Waves

Surface waves combines characteristics of both transverse and longitudinal waves. These waves occur at the interface between two different media, most commonly observed as ocean waves at the air-water boundary. In surface waves, particles trace elliptical paths, exhibiting both vertical and horizontal motion components.

The complexity of surface waves becomes apparent in ocean waves, where water particles near the surface move in nearly circular paths that become increasingly elliptical with depth. This motion creates the characteristic rolling pattern of ocean waves, where both the surface height and the horizontal position of water particles vary periodically.

The mathematical description of surface waves often requires combining multiple wave equations:

$\eta(x,t) = A\cos(kx - \omega t)$ for vertical displacement
$\xi(x,t) = A\sin(kx - \omega t)$ for horizontal displacement

where $\eta$ and $\xi$ represent the vertical and horizontal displacements respectively.

### Applications and Significance

Understanding the direction of particle oscillation in waves has a deep practical implications:

In seismology, P-waves (longitudinal) arrive before S-waves (transverse) during earthquakes, providing crucial early warning capabilities. The speed difference arises from their different propagation mechanisms—P-waves compress and expand the medium, while S-waves involve shear deformation.

In fiber optic communications, the transverse nature of light waves enables multiplexing—multiple signals can be transmitted simultaneously using different polarization states, dramatically increasing data transmission capacity.

In medical ultrasound, longitudinal waves penetrate tissue layers, creating detailed images through their reflection patterns. The choice of frequency and wave type directly affects imaging resolution and depth penetration.

### Technological Applications

The distinct properties of different wave types find numerous applications in modern technology:

1. Noise Cancellation Systems utilize the properties of longitudinal sound waves to create anti-phase waves that neutralize unwanted noise.

2. Optical Devices exploit the transverse nature of light waves through polarizers and wave plates to control light transmission and create various optical effects.

3. Seismic Monitoring Systems differentiate between P-waves and S-waves to analyze Earth's structure and predict volcanic activity.

Understanding the direction of particle oscillation in waves continues to drive innovations in fields ranging from communications technology to medical imaging, demonstrating the fundamental importance of wave physics in modern science and engineering.

## 3. **Waveform and Behavior**

### Waveform and Behavior: The Patterns of Wave Motion

The study of waveforms and wave behavior reveals the intricate patterns that waves can exhibit as they propagate through space and time. These patterns range from simple pulses to complex standing waves, each with unique characteristics and applications. Understanding these different forms helps us comprehend everything from musical instruments to quantum mechanics.

### Pulse Waves: The Solitary Disturbance

A pulse wave represents the simplest form of wave motion—a single, localized disturbance traveling through a medium. Unlike periodic waves, pulse waves occur as isolated events, making them particularly useful for studying basic wave properties. Consider dropping a single stone into a still pond: the resulting circular ripple demonstrates a pulse wave in two dimensions.

The mathematical description of a pulse wave often takes the form of a localized function, such as a Gaussian pulse:

$y(x,t) = A e^{-\frac{(x-vt)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$

where $A$ is the amplitude, $v$ is the wave speed, and $\sigma$ determines the pulse width. This equation describes how the pulse maintains its shape while traveling at speed $v$, though in real media, dispersion often causes the pulse to spread out over time.

### Periodic Waves: The Rhythmic Oscillations

Periodic waves represent a continuous pattern of oscillations that repeat at regular intervals. These waves form the backbone of numerous natural phenomena and technological applications. The simplest and most fundamental form is the sinusoidal wave, described by the equation:

$y(x,t) = A \sin(kx - \omega t + \phi)$

This equation encapsulates several key wave parameters:
- $A$ represents the amplitude, determining the wave's maximum displacement
- $k$ is the wave number ($2\pi/\lambda$), relating to spatial periodicity
- $\omega$ is the angular frequency ($2\pi f$), determining temporal periodicity
- $\phi$ is the phase constant, setting the initial conditions

While sinusoidal waves are idealized forms, they serve as building blocks for more complex wave patterns through the principle of superposition. French mathematician Joseph Fourier showed that any periodic waveform can be decomposed into a sum of sinusoidal waves of different frequencies—a profound insight that revolutionized our understanding of wave phenomena.

### Standing Waves: The Stationary Oscillations

Standing waves emerge when waves traveling in opposite directions interfere constructively and destructively to create a pattern that appears to stand still. This phenomenon plays a crucial role in musical instruments, architectural acoustics, and quantum mechanics.

The mathematical description of a standing wave results from the superposition of two traveling waves:

$y(x,t) = 2A \sin(kx) \cos(\omega t)$

This equation reveals several fascinating features:
- **Nodes**: Points where $\sin(kx) = 0$, resulting in permanent zero displacement
- **Antinodes**: Points where $\sin(kx) = \pm 1$, showing maximum oscillation
- **Spatial Pattern**: Determined by $\sin(kx)$, fixed in space
- **Temporal Oscillation**: Governed by $\cos(\omega t)$, affecting all points simultaneously

The formation of standing waves requires specific boundary conditions. For instance, in a string fixed at both ends (like a guitar string), only certain wavelengths are possible, given by:

$\lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}$

where $L$ is the string length and $n$ is a positive integer. This quantization of wavelengths leads to the harmonic series in musical instruments.

### Wave Packets: The Bridge to Quantum Mechanics

Wave packets represent a fascinating intermediate between pulse waves and periodic waves. They consist of a superposition of waves with different frequencies, creating a localized disturbance that maintains some periodic character. The concept becomes particularly important in quantum mechanics, where wave packets describe the behavior of particles.

A typical wave packet can be described mathematically as:

$\Psi(x,t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} A(k)e^{i(kx-\omega(k)t)}dk$

where $A(k)$ represents the amplitude distribution of different wavelengths. This formulation leads to important concepts like group velocity and dispersion, crucial for understanding wave propagation in various media.

### Applications in Modern Physics and Technology

The understanding of different waveforms and behaviors has profound practical applications:

In music, standing waves in strings, air columns, and membranes create the specific frequencies we recognize as musical notes. The harmonic series, determined by the allowed standing wave patterns, gives each instrument its characteristic timbre.

In fiber optic communications, understanding pulse wave behavior helps engineers combat signal dispersion, enabling high-speed data transmission across vast distances.

In quantum mechanics, wave packets describe the position and momentum of particles, leading to the famous uncertainty principle and the probabilistic nature of quantum phenomena.

The study of waveforms and behavior continues to yield new insights and applications, from the development of novel musical instruments to the design of quantum computers. This understanding forms a bridge between classical wave physics and modern quantum theories, demonstrating the deep unity underlying seemingly diverse physical phenomena.



## Mathematical Description of Waves

### Key Parameters

$\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = v^2 \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}$

**Solutions** include:
- Traveling waves: $y = A \sin(kx \pm \omega t)$
- Standing waves: $y = 2A \sin(kx) \cos(\omega t)$

## Special Wave Phenomena

### Doppler Effect
Change in observed frequency due to relative motion between source and observer.

![Doppler Effect](/content/waves-and-oscillations/wave-fundamentals/images/doppler-effect.svg)

The frequency increases as the source approaches and decreases as it moves away.

### Wave Refraction
When waves pass from one medium to another, they change direction due to a change in wave speed.

![Wave Refraction](/content/waves-and-oscillations/wave-fundamentals/images/wave-refraction.svg)

This behavior is described by Snell's Law: $n_1\sin(\theta_1) = n_2\sin(\theta_2)$

### Superposition Principle
When two waves meet, their displacements add algebraically. This leads to:

1. **Interference**:
   - Constructive: $\phi_1 - \phi_2 = 0, 2\pi$
   - Destructive: $\phi_1 - \phi_2 = \pi$

2. **Beats**:
   Periodic variations in amplitude from two slightly different frequencies:
   
   $f_{\text{beat}} = |f_1 - f_2|$

- **Radio Waves**: Communication (TV, radio)
- **Microwaves**: Radar, cooking
- **Visible Light**: Optics, photography
- **X-rays**: Medical imaging ($\lambda \sim 0.01\text{--}10 \text{ nm}$)

### 2. Seismology
- **P-waves**: Compressional, travel through solids and liquids
- **S-waves**: Shear waves, only through solids

### 3. Quantum Mechanics
- **Electron Diffraction**: Demonstrates wave-particle duality (Davisson-Germer experiment)
- **Schrödinger Equation**: Governs matter waves:

  $i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \Psi + V\Psi$

  where:
  - $\Psi$ is the wave function
  - $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant
  - $m$ is the mass of the particle
  - $V$ is the potential energy
  - $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator

---



## Wave Parameters and Their Relationships

Essential wave parameters include:

1. Wavelength ($\lambda$): The distance between two consecutive similar points on a wave
2. Frequency ($f$): The number of complete oscillations per second
3. Period ($T$): Time for one complete oscillation
4. Wave speed ($v$): The speed at which the wave propagates

These parameters are related by fundamental equations:
- $v = f\lambda$
- $T = \frac{1}{f}$
- $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$
- $\omega = 2\pi f$

## Quantum Mechanical Waves

The wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics introduces a new perspective on waves. The de Broglie wavelength associated with particles is given by:

$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$

where:
- $h$ is Planck's constant ($6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J}\cdot\text{s}$)
- $p$ is the particle's momentum ($p = mv$)

For a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$:

$\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}$

### Energy Transport in Wave Systems

As waves propagate through space, they carry energy in a fascinating interplay between kinetic and potential forms. Consider a wave traveling along a string: as each segment oscillates, energy continuously transforms between the kinetic energy of moving particles and the potential energy stored in the string's tension. This energy transport mechanism underlies phenomena from ocean waves to quantum fields.

The mathematical description of this energy distribution emerges from the wave equation. In a continuous medium, the total energy density at any point combines two contributions:

$E_{total} = E_k + E_p = \frac{1}{2}\rho(\frac{\partial y}{\partial t})^2 + \frac{1}{2}T(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x})^2$

For harmonic waves, this expression time-averages to a remarkably simple form:

$\langle E \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\mu\omega^2A^2$

This equation reveals how energy density scales with the square of both frequency ($\omega$) and amplitude ($A$), a relationship that proves crucial in applications from musical acoustics to seismic analysis.

### Power Flow and Wave Intensity

The flow of energy through space follows distinct patterns depending on the wave geometry. At any point, the instantaneous power flow through a cross-section arises from the interaction between the wave's force and velocity components:

$P(t) = T\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}$

Time-averaging reveals the mean power flow:

$\langle P \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\mu\omega^2A^2v$

This expression demonstrates how power transmission depends on the wave's speed ($v$), a crucial factor in designing everything from musical instruments to optical fibers.

As waves spread out in three dimensions, their intensity distribution follows geometric principles:

1. For spherical waves (like sound from a point source):
   $I(r) = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}$
   This inverse square law explains why sound intensity decreases rapidly with distance.

2. For cylindrical waves (like ripples on a pond):
   $I(r) = \frac{P}{2\pi rh}$
   The slower decay with distance affects applications in surface acoustics and water waves.

3. For plane waves (like light in fiber optics):
   $I = \frac{P}{A}$
   The constant intensity with distance enables long-distance optical communication.

### Applications in Modern Technology

These principles find practical application across diverse fields:

1. In acoustics, impedance matching ($Z = \rho v$) determines energy transfer efficiency, crucial for:
   - Ultrasound imaging in medical diagnostics
   - High-fidelity audio systems
   - Noise reduction in architectural design

2. In wave transmission systems, the energy transfer coefficient:
   $T = \frac{4Z_1Z_2}{(Z_1 + Z_2)^2}$
   guides the design of:
   - Optical fiber connections
   - Acoustic metamaterials
   - Electromagnetic waveguides

3. In standing wave systems, the energy distribution:
   $E(x) = 4E_0\sin^2(kx)$
   explains phenomena in:
   - Musical instrument resonance
   - Laser cavity design
   - Microwave waveguides

The practical significance of these relationships extends from quantum mechanics to civil engineering, demonstrating the universal importance of wave energy transport in modern technology.

### Unifying Principles in Wave Physics

The mathematical structure of wave phenomena reveals fundamental unity across physical systems through the wave equation:

$\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial t^2} = v^2\nabla^2\psi$

This equation governs wave propagation from vibrating strings to quantum fields. The nature of wave-medium interaction determines propagation characteristics: mechanical waves require material media, electromagnetic waves traverse vacuum at $c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0\epsilon_0}}$, and matter waves exhibit quantum properties with wavelength $\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$.

### Wave Control and Manipulation

In optical communications, wave speed in fibers follows $v = \frac{c}{n(\omega)}$, enabling precise control through waveguide design and dispersion management. Modern fiber networks achieve high bandwidth through careful mode control and chromatic dispersion compensation. Acoustic metamaterials extend this control by engineering spatial distributions of density $\rho(\vec{r})$ and compressibility $\kappa(\vec{r})$, creating designed wave propagation paths with controlled reflection and transmission properties.

Photonic devices exploit band structure engineering through $\omega(\vec{k})$ relationships, enabling light confinement and frequency-selective transmission. These principles form the basis of modern optical filters, waveguides, and resonators used in telecommunications and sensing applications.

### Precision Measurement

Wave phenomena enable extraordinary measurement precision. Gravitational wave detectors achieve strain sensitivity of $\Delta L \sim 10^{-18}$ m through advanced laser interferometry and quantum noise reduction techniques. Quantum measurement systems operate at the Heisenberg limit $\Delta x\Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$, employing squeezed states and back-action evasion for enhanced precision.

Microscopy systems push resolution boundaries through the relationship $d_{min} = \frac{\lambda}{2NA}$. Super-resolution techniques and near-field imaging methods overcome traditional diffraction limits, enabling nanoscale observation and manipulation of matter.

### Information Processing

Quantum computing harnesses wave mechanics through superposition states $|\psi\rangle = \sum_i c_i|i\rangle$. Coherent manipulation of these states, combined with error correction protocols, enables quantum algorithms and simulations beyond classical capabilities. Optical computing exploits non-linear wave mixing $\chi^{(n)}E^n$ for phase-based logic and parallel processing, while neural processors utilize wave equations $\nabla^2\psi + k^2n^2(\vec{r})\psi = 0$ for analog computation and pattern recognition.

The ongoing development of wave physics continues to advance technology across scales, from quantum devices to gravitational wave observatories. Understanding wave-matter interactions provides the foundation for next-generation measurement systems and computational architectures.

c) Calculate the wavelength of each wave if the frequency is 0.5 Hz

**Solution:**
a) Distance calculation:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   d &= \frac{v_p v_s \Delta t}{v_p - v_s} \\
   &= \frac{(6)(3.5)(30)}{6 - 3.5} \\
   &= 315 \text{ km}
   \end{aligned}
   $$

b) Wave characteristics:
   - P-waves are longitudinal compression waves
   - S-waves are transverse shear waves
   - P-waves travel faster through rock due to higher elastic modulus for compression

c) Wavelengths:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   \lambda_p &= \frac{v_p}{f} = \frac{6000}{0.5} = 12 \text{ km} \\
   \lambda_s &= \frac{v_s}{f} = \frac{3500}{0.5} = 7 \text{ km}
   \end{aligned}
   $$

### Problem 6: Water Waves in a Harbor

Ocean waves enter a harbor with wavelength 50 m and amplitude 1.2 m.
a) Calculate the wave speed in deep water (depth > λ/2)
b) Find the new wavelength when the depth decreases to 5 m
c) Explain why wave height increases near the shore

**Solution:**
a) Deep water speed:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   v &= \sqrt{\frac{g\lambda}{2\pi}} \\
   &= \sqrt{\frac{9.81 \times 50}{2\pi}} \\
   &= 8.82 \text{ m/s}
   \end{aligned}
   $$

b) Shallow water wavelength:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   v_{\text{shallow}} &= \sqrt{gh} = \sqrt{9.81 \times 5} = 7.01 \text{ m/s} \\
   \lambda_{\text{new}} &= \frac{v_{\text{shallow}}}{f} = \frac{7.01}{8.82/50} = 39.7 \text{ m}
   \end{aligned}
   $$

c) Wave height increase:
   - Energy conservation requires E ∝ A²λ
   - As λ decreases, A must increase
   - Wave shoaling follows: $A_2 = A_1\sqrt{\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2}}$

### Problem 7: Radio Wave Propagation

A radio station broadcasts at 88.5 MHz with a power of 50 kW from an omnidirectional antenna.
a) Calculate the wavelength of the radio waves
b) Find the electric field amplitude at 10 km from the antenna
c) Determine the wave's penetration depth in seawater (conductivity σ = 4 S/m)

**Solution:**
a) Wavelength:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   \lambda &= \frac{c}{f} \\
   &= \frac{3\times10^8}{88.5\times10^6} \\
   &= 3.39 \text{ m}
   \end{aligned}
   $$

b) Electric field:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   E &= \sqrt{\frac{30P}{r^2}} \\
   &= \sqrt{\frac{30 \times 50000}{(10000)^2}} \\
   &= 0.387 \text{ V/m}
   \end{aligned}
   $$

c) Penetration depth:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   \delta &= \sqrt{\frac{2}{\omega\mu_0\sigma}} \\
   &= \sqrt{\frac{2}{2\pi(88.5\times10^6)(4\pi\times10^{-7})(4)}} \\
   &= 0.085 \text{ m}
   \end{aligned}
   $$

### Problem 8: Musical String Harmonics

A guitar string of length 65 cm is tuned to produce A₄ (440 Hz) as its fundamental frequency.
a) Calculate the wave speed on the string
b) Find the frequencies of the first three overtones
c) Determine the tension if the linear density is 3.0 g/m

**Solution:**
a) Wave speed:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   v &= f\lambda = f(2L) \\
   &= 440 \times (2 \times 0.65) \\
   &= 572 \text{ m/s}
   \end{aligned}
   $$

b) Overtone frequencies:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   f_2 &= 880 \text{ Hz (A₅)} \\
   f_3 &= 1320 \text{ Hz (E₆)} \\
   f_4 &= 1760 \text{ Hz (A₆)}
   \end{aligned}
   $$

c) String tension:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   T &= \mu v^2 \\
   &= (0.003)(572)^2 \\
   &= 982 \text{ N}
   \end{aligned}
   $$
