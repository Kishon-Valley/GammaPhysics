# Position and Displacement

## Overview
Position and displacement are fundamental concepts in kinematics that help us describe the motion of objects in space.

## Position
Position is a vector quantity that describes the location of an object relative to a chosen reference point (origin).

### Key Points
- Measured in meters (m) in SI units
- Requires both magnitude and direction
- Always relative to a reference point
- Represented by coordinates (x, y, z) in 3D space

### Mathematical Representation
The position vector $\vec{r}$ in 3D space is given by:
$\vec{r} = x\hat{i} + y\hat{j} + z\hat{k}$

where:
- $x$, $y$, $z$ are scalar components
- $\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$, $\hat{k}$ are unit vectors in the x, y, and z directions

## Displacement
Displacement is the change in position of an object, measured from its initial to its final position.

### Key Points
- Vector quantity (has both magnitude and direction)
- Independent of the path taken
- Can be zero even if motion occurs
- Represented by the symbol Δr or s

### Mathematical Formula
$\Delta \vec{r} = \vec{r}_f - \vec{r}_i$

where:
- $\vec{r}_f$ is the final position vector
- $\vec{r}_i$ is the initial position vector

### Examples
1. **Linear Motion**
   - A car drives 5 km east, then 3 km north
   - Final displacement: ~5.83 km at 31° north of east
   - Calculated using: $|\Delta \vec{r}| = \sqrt{5^2 + 3^2}$ km

2. **Circular Motion**
   - A runner completes one lap of a circular track
   - Total distance traveled: circumference of track
   - Displacement: zero (returns to starting point)

## Applications
- GPS Navigation
- Robotics and automation
- Sports analysis
- Civil engineering and construction
- Particle physics experiments

## Common Misconceptions
1. **Distance vs. Displacement**
   - Distance is a scalar (magnitude only)
   - Displacement is a vector (magnitude and direction)
   - Distance ≥ |Displacement|

2. **Position vs. Distance**
   - Position is a vector from origin to object
   - Distance is a scalar measuring path length
