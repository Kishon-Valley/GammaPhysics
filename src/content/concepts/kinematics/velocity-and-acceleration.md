# Velocity and Acceleration

## Velocity

### Definition
Velocity is the rate of change of position with respect to time. It is a vector quantity that specifies both the speed of an object and the direction of its motion.

### Instantaneous Velocity
The velocity at a specific instant in time, defined as:
$\vec{v} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}$

### Average Velocity
The average velocity over a time interval:
$\vec{v}_{avg} = \frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\vec{r}_f - \vec{r}_i}{t_f - t_i}$

### Key Properties
- Vector quantity (has magnitude and direction)
- SI unit: meters per second (m/s)
- Can be positive, negative, or zero
- Instantaneous velocity is tangent to path of motion
- Direction indicates where object is heading

## Acceleration

### Definition
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. It represents how quickly an object's velocity is changing.

### Instantaneous Acceleration
$\vec{a} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t} = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = \frac{d^2\vec{r}}{dt^2}$

### Average Acceleration
$\vec{a}_{avg} = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\vec{v}_f - \vec{v}_i}{t_f - t_i}$

### Types of Acceleration
1. **Linear Acceleration**
   - Change in speed (magnitude of velocity)
   - Direction of motion remains constant

2. **Centripetal Acceleration**
   - Change in direction of velocity
   - Speed remains constant
   - Points toward center of circular path
   - Magnitude: $a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$

3. **Angular Acceleration**
   - Rate of change of angular velocity
   - Measured in radians per second squared (rad/sÂ²)

## Real-World Applications

### Transportation
- Vehicle acceleration and braking
- Aircraft takeoff and landing
- Train speed control
- Elevator motion

### Sports
- Sprinter's acceleration from starting blocks
- Baseball pitcher's throw
- Golf club swing
- Tennis serve

### Technology
- Smartphone accelerometers
- Roller coaster design
- Satellite orbital mechanics
- Particle accelerators

## Advanced Concepts

### Relative Velocity
- Velocity measured relative to different reference frames
- Vector addition of velocities
- Galilean transformation (classical mechanics)

### Non-Uniform Acceleration
- Varying acceleration
- Jerk (rate of change of acceleration)
- Complex motion analysis

## Problem-Solving Strategies

### Kinematic Equations
For constant acceleration:
1. $v_f = v_i + at$
2. $\Delta x = v_it + \frac{1}{2}at^2$
3. $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a\Delta x$
4. $\Delta x = \frac{v_i + v_f}{2}t$

### Steps for Solving Problems
1. Identify known quantities
2. Choose appropriate reference frame
3. Select relevant kinematic equation(s)
4. Solve algebraically
5. Check units and reasonableness of answer
