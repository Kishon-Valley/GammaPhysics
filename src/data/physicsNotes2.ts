        title: 'Maxwell Relations',
        content: `Maxwell Relations are mathematical equations that connect different thermodynamic variables through the equality of mixed partial derivatives. They provide powerful tools for analyzing thermodynamic systems and calculating quantities that are difficult to measure directly.

Derivation and Mathematical Formulation
Maxwell Relations are derived from the differential forms of thermodynamic potentials:

1. From Internal Energy (U):
   (∂T/∂V)S = -(∂P/∂S)V
   • U = U(S,V): Internal energy as function of entropy and volume
   • dU = TdS - PdV: First law of thermodynamics
   • T = (∂U/∂S)V: Temperature definition
   • P = -(∂U/∂V)S: Pressure definition

2. From Enthalpy (H = U + PV):
   (∂T/∂P)S = (∂V/∂S)P
   • H = H(S,P): Enthalpy as function of entropy and pressure
   • dH = TdS + VdP: Differential form

3. From Helmholtz Free Energy (F = U - TS):
   (∂P/∂T)V = (∂S/∂V)T
   • F = F(T,V): Free energy as function of temperature and volume
   • dF = -SdT - PdV: Differential form

4. From Gibbs Free Energy (G = H - TS):
   (∂V/∂T)P = -(∂S/∂P)T
   • G = G(T,P): Gibbs energy as function of temperature and pressure
   • dG = -SdT + VdP: Differential form

Physical Significance
Maxwell Relations connect measurable quantities and reveal how thermodynamic variables affect each other:

• They show how temperature changes with volume at constant entropy equals negative of how pressure changes with entropy at constant volume
• They relate thermal expansion to heat capacity
• They connect isothermal compressibility to heat capacity
• They provide paths to calculate entropy changes indirectly

Applications in Thermodynamics
Maxwell Relations are used to:
• Calculate entropy changes from PVT data
• Derive relationships between heat capacities (CP - CV = T(∂V/∂T)P²/(∂V/∂P)T)
• Analyze phase transitions and critical phenomena
• Determine thermodynamic stability conditions
• Simplify complex thermodynamic calculations
• Develop equations of state for real systems

Examples in Physical Systems
• Ideal gases: Verify PV = nRT using Maxwell Relations
• Magnetic systems: Relate magnetization changes to temperature and field

• Refrigeration cycles: Optimize cooling efficiency
• Chemical reactions: Predict equilibrium shifts with temperature and pressure`
