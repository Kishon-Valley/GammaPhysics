• Basic interaction:

• Linear Stark effect:

  - Mathematical formulation by Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker
  - Led to semi-empirical mass formula

        title: 'Fission Mechanism',
        content: `The liquid drop model explains nuclear fission:

• Deformation process:
  - Nucleus deforms from spherical to elongated shape
  - Two competing forces: surface tension and Coulomb repulsion
  - Surface tension increases with deformation (resists fission)
  - Coulomb repulsion decreases with deformation (promotes fission)
  - Critical point: saddle point in potential energy surface

• Fissility parameter:
  - X = (Coulomb energy)/(2 × surface energy)
  - X = (Z²/A)/(50.13)
  - X < 1: Spontaneous fission unlikely
  - X > 1: Spontaneous fission possible
  - For uranium-235: X ≈ 0.7 (requires energy input)
  - For fermium-258: X ≈ 1.0 (spontaneous fission)

• Energy release:
  - Primarily from increased binding energy of fragments
  - Kinetic energy of fragments (~170 MeV)
  - Neutron emission (~5 MeV)
  - Gamma radiation (~7 MeV)
  - Beta decays of fragments (~13 MeV)
  - Total: ~200 MeV per fission event`

        title: 'Model Limitations and Extensions',
        content: `The liquid drop model has limitations and has been extended:

• Limitations:
  - Does not explain magic numbers and shell structure
  - Cannot account for nuclear spins and moments
  - Poor predictions for some deformed nuclei
  - Inadequate for exotic nuclei far from stability
  - No explanation for clustering phenomena

• Extensions and refinements:
  - Strutinsky method: Combines liquid drop with shell effects
  - Droplet model: Includes surface diffuseness, neutron skin
  - Rotating liquid drop model: Accounts for angular momentum
  - Finite-range liquid drop model: Improved surface energy
  - Temperature-dependent liquid drop model: Excited states

• Complementary models:
  - Shell model: Explains magic numbers, spins, moments
  - Collective model: Describes rotations and vibrations
  - Alpha-cluster model: Explains structure of light nuclei
  - Ab initio methods: Calculate properties from nucleon interactions
  - Each model has specific domains of applicability`

    title: 'Shell Model',
    description: 'A quantum mechanical model of the nucleus that explains nuclear structure in terms of energy levels and shell closures, analogous to the electron shell model in atoms.',

      {
        title: 'Nuclear Shell Structure',
        content: `The nuclear shell model explains nuclear structure using quantum mechanics:

• Magic numbers:
  - Nuclei with specific numbers of protons or neutrons (2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126) show enhanced stability
  - Similar to electron shell closures in atoms
  - Evidence includes abundance patterns, binding energy discontinuities, and nuclear decay rates
  - Closed shells create spherical nuclei with zero spin for even-even nuclei

• Spin-orbit coupling:
  - Strong nuclear force creates significant spin-orbit interaction
  - Splits energy levels based on alignment of nucleon spin with orbital angular momentum
  - Essential for explaining the observed magic numbers
  - Much stronger than in atomic electron shells

• Model predictions:
  - Ground-state spins and parities of odd-A nuclei
  - Excited state energy levels and transition probabilities
  - Magnetic and electric multipole moments
  - Beta decay selection rules and transition rates

• Mathematical framework:
  - Independent particle approximation with effective potential
  - Nucleons fill energy levels according to Pauli exclusion principle
  - Angular momentum coupling schemes (j-j coupling)
  - Residual interactions treated as perturbations

• Historical development:
  - Proposed by Maria Goeppert-Mayer and Hans Jensen (1949)
  - Nobel Prize in Physics (1963)
  - Extended by subsequent researchers to include configuration mixing and collective effects
  - Provides microscopic basis for understanding nuclear structure`
