                Parallel resonance occurs in a parallel RLC circuit when the inductive and capacitive reactances are equal. 
                At the resonance frequency, the circuit impedance reaches its maximum value, and the current drawn from the source is minimum.

              <p className="mb-4">
                The resonance frequency is given by: f<sub>r</sub> = 1/(2π√(LC))
